## Surface Representation and Alignment
### Signed Distance Fields
Given a point calculate the SDF function for:
- sphere
- torus
- atom: combines sphere and torus SDF function
- SDF grids: build an SDF grid that shows the implicit representation in a cube of size 1x1x1
- Visualization of `.ply` objects in `MeshLab`
### Conversion from SDF Grids to Occupancy Grids
### Conversion From SDF to Triangle Meshes
- Marching Cubes
- Vertex Interpolation
- Export triangle meshes as `Wavefront OJB`
### Conversion from Triangle Meshes to Point Clouds
- Sample n points using barycentric coordinates for each triangle
- Export point cloud as `Wavefront OBJ`
### Rigid Shape Alignment with Procrustes
- align two shapes given near-perfect point correspondences using procrustes
